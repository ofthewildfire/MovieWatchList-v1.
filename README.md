# Watchlist Movie App

This is a Scrimba Frontend Path solo project.

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

# Currently

- [x] The search functionality works / fetch from the omdb api and it retunrs an
array of movies which are renderd on the page.

- [x] LocalStorage works

- [x] Removing from localStorage works

# Task list

- [ ] Check if movie already exists to prevent duplicates being added. I am
      having trouble here, at first thought to try includes, but implementation
      is proving a headkick, will keep at it.

- [ ] A better UI / currently as I wanted to practice grid I have used Grid --
      also because grid makes it collapse to one card when the screen size
      changes, and I like that. Will keep improving.

# Final note

Any feedback appreciated. <3
